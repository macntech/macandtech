## macandtech.com Ghost Theme

Ghost Theme for my personal blog `macandtech.com`. You can use this theme under GPL for your own projects. 

### Development

Theme based on Ghost v5. You need Node>v16 and npm>v8. 

Clone repo and install deps with
```bash
npm install
```

Compile SASS before commit with:
```bash
npm run sass
```

Theme has an deployment `workflow` with Github actions so that you can auto deploy any changes directly into your Ghost installation. 

Routes need to be manually updated based on the `routes.yaml`
