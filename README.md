## macandtech.com Ghost Theme

Ghost Theme for my personal blog macandtech.com. You can use this theme under GPL for your own projects. 

### Development

Theme based on Ghost v5. You need Node>v16 and npm>v8. 

Clone repo and install deps with
```bash
npm install
```

Compile SASS before commit with:
```bash
sass ./assets/sass/main.scss ./assets/css/main.css
```
use --watch flag for development.

Theme has an automatic deployment on the running page with Github actions. Routes need to be manually updated.
